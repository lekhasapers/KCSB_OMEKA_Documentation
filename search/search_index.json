SSH Key An SSH key is a pair of cryptographic keys used to authenticate and secure communication between computers over a network. The keys consist of a private key (kept secret) and a public key (shared with servers), providing a secure method of logging into a server remotely without a password. How to Create an SSH Key: Open a Terminal : Open a terminal on your local machine. Generate SSH Key : Use the following command to generate a new SSH key pair: sh ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\" Replace \"your_email@example.com\" with your email address. Save the Key : When prompted, press Enter to save the key in the default location ( ~/.ssh/id_rsa ) or specify a different location. Set a Passphrase : Optionally, enter a passphrase for added security. Add SSH Key to SSH Agent : Start the SSH agent and add your SSH private key: sh eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\" ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa Copy Public Key to Clipboard : Use the following command to copy your public key to the clipboard: sh pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub If pbcopy is not available, you can manually copy the key from the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file. Add Public Key to Server : Add your SSH public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server you want to access. Theme The visual design and layout of an Omeka site. Themes determine how content is displayed to users and can be customized or developed to fit the branding of an organization. User Role The permissions and access levels assigned to users within Omeka. Common roles include Administrator, Editor, and Viewer, each with different capabilities for managing content and settings.

Install Elementary OS Install Elementary OS from the official website and follow the installation instructions. 2. Install Apache Install Apache HTTP Server: sh sudo apt update sudo apt install apache2 Enable mod_rewrite : sh sudo a2enmod rewrite sudo systemctl restart apache2 Verification: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost . This will prompt the Apache2 default welcome page. 3. Configure Firewall Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic through the firewall: sh sudo ufw allow in \"Apache Full\" 4. Install MySQL Install MySQL Server: sh sudo apt install mysql-server sudo mysql_secure_installation Secure MySQL Installation: sh sudo mysql -u root -p Create a database and a user for Omeka-S: sql CREATE DATABASE omeka_s; CREATE USER 'omeka_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON omeka_s.* TO 'omeka_user'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; EXIT; Verification: Log into MySQL and check the databases: sh sudo mysql -u root -p SHOW DATABASES; Ensure the Omeka-S database is listed. 5. Install PHP and Required Extensions Install PHP and required extensions: sh sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-json php-mbstring php-xml php-dom php-simplexml php-fileinfo php-curl php-gd Verification: Create a PHP File to verify installation: sh echo \"<?php phpinfo(); ?>\" | sudo tee /var/www/html/info.php Navigate to http://localhost/info.php , where the PHP information page will be visible. 6. Advanced PHP Configuration Adjust PHP settings for better performance: sh sudo nano /etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini This subsequent part is very important and something that I had trouble with. Don't forget to do this. Suggested adjustments: memory_limit = 256M upload_max_filesize = 64M post_max_size = 64M max_execution_time = 300 7. Install Composer and Git Install Composer and Git: sh sudo apt install composer sudo apt install git Version Control Verification: sh composer --version git --version 8. Install Omeka S Navigate to the web root and clone the Omeka S repository: sh cd /var/www/html sudo git clone https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s.git 9.

Backing Up Omeka S Overview Backing up Omeka S involves two main components: 1. Omeka S Files : This includes the application files, configuration files, themes, plugins, and uploaded files. 2. Database : Omeka S uses a database (typically MySQL) to store all metadata, settings, and relationships. Both components must be backed up regularly to ensure a complete and restorable backup. Prerequisites Access to the server where Omeka S is installed. Administrative privileges to access files and databases. Basic knowledge of command-line operations Step 1: Backing Up Omeka S Files Manual Backup Connect to Your Server : Use SSH to connect to your server. I've been using 'archives@128.111.126.136', but I'm not sure if you're on the same computer, so you may have to set that up on your own. sh ssh username@your-server-ip Navigate to the Omeka S Directory : Locate the directory where Omeka S is installed. sh cd /var/www/html/omeka-s Create a Compressed Archive : Use the tar command to create a compressed archive of the Omeka S directory. sh tar -czvf omeka-s-backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz . This command creates a tar.gz file named with the current date. Move the Backup File : Move the backup file to a safe location. sh mv omeka-s-backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz /path/to/backup/location Automated Backup (Using a Cron Job) Create a Backup Script : Create a shell script to automate the backup process. sh nano backup-omeka-s.sh Add the following content to the script: sh #!/bin/bash BACKUP_DIR=\"/path/to/backup/location\" OMEKA_DIR=\"/path/to/omeka-s\" TIMESTAMP=$(date +%F) tar -czvf $BACKUP_DIR/omeka-s-backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz -C $OMEKA_DIR . Save and close the file. Make the Script Executable : sh chmod +x backup-omeka-s.sh Create a Cron Job : Open the crontab editor. sh crontab -e Add the following line to schedule the backup script to run daily at midnight: sh 0 0 * * * /path/to/backup-omeka-s.sh Step 2: Backing Up the Database Manual Backup Dump the Database : Use the mysqldump command to create a backup of the Omeka S database. sh mysqldump -u username -p omeka_database > omeka-db-backup-$(date +%F).sql Enter your MySQL password when prompted. Move the Backup File : Move the SQL file to a safe location. sh mv omeka-db-backup-$(date +%F).sql /path/to/backup/location Automated Backup (Using a Cron Job) Create a Database Backup Script : Create a shell script to automate the database backup process. sh nano backup-omeka-db.sh Add the following content to the script: sh #!/bin/bash BACKUP_DIR=\"/path/to/backup/location\" DB_USER=\"username\" DB_PASS=\"password\" DB_NAME=\"omeka_database\" TIMESTAMP=$(date +%F) mysqldump -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASS $DB_NAME > $BACKUP_DIR/omeka-db-backup-$TIMESTAMP.sql Save and close the file. Make the Script Executable : sh chmod +x backup-omeka-db.sh Create a Cron Job : Open the crontab editor. sh crontab -e Add the following line to schedule the database backup script to run daily at 1 AM: sh 0 1 * * * /path/to/backup-omeka-db.sh Step 3: Verifying Backups List Backup Files : Check the backup location to ensure the files are created. sh ls /path/to/backup/location Test Restoration : Periodically test the restoration process to ensure backups are valid and complete. Regularly backing up your Omeka S installation is critical for data integrity and disaster recovery. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can ensure that both your files and database are safely backed up and can be restored if needed.","title":"Maintenance"},{"location":"maintenance/#maintenance-and-troubleshooting","text":"","title":"Maintenance and Troubleshooting"},{"location":"maintenance/#keeping-the-lamp-stack-updated","text":"To ensure the LAMP stack remains secure and compatible with Omeka S, follow these steps to keep your system and software updated:","title":"Keeping the LAMP Stack Updated"},{"location":"maintenance/#update-package-lists","text":"sudo apt update","title":"Update Package Lists"},{"location":"maintenance/#upgrade-installed-packages","text":"sudo apt upgrade","title":"Upgrade Installed Packages"},{"location":"maintenance/#full-distribution-upgrade","text":"sudo apt dist-upgrade","title":"Full Distribution Upgrade"},{"location":"maintenance/#version-control-maintenance","text":"Ensure appropriate versions for Apache, MySQL, PHP: sudo apt install apache2 mysql-server php Check for specific version updates: Apache: sh apache2 -v MySQL: sh mysql --version PHP: sh php -v","title":"Version Control Maintenance"},{"location":"maintenance/#configure-automatic-security-updates","text":"Install unattended-upgrades package: sudo apt install unattended-upgrades Enable automatic updates: sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades By following these guidelines, KCSB\u2019s Omeka LAMP stack will remain up to date and secure, minimizing the risk of deprecation and ensuring continued compatibility with Omeka S.","title":"Configure Automatic Security Updates"},{"location":"maintenance/#backing-up-omeka-s","text":"","title":"Backing Up Omeka S"},{"location":"maintenance/#overview","text":"Backing up Omeka S involves two main components: 1.
