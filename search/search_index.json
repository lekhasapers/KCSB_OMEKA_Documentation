Install Elementary OS Install Elementary OS from the official website and follow the installation instructions. 2. Install Apache Install Apache HTTP Server: sh sudo apt update sudo apt install apache2 Enable mod_rewrite : sh sudo a2enmod rewrite sudo systemctl restart apache2 Verification: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost . This will prompt the Apache2 default welcome page. 3. Configure Firewall Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic through the firewall: sh sudo ufw allow in \"Apache Full\" 4. Install MySQL Install MySQL Server: sh sudo apt install mysql-server sudo mysql_secure_installation Secure MySQL Installation: sh sudo mysql -u root -p Create a database and a user for Omeka-S: sql CREATE DATABASE omeka_s; CREATE USER 'omeka_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON omeka_s.* TO 'omeka_user'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; EXIT; Verification: Log into MySQL and check the databases: sh sudo mysql -u root -p SHOW DATABASES; Ensure the Omeka-S database is listed. 5. Install PHP and Required Extensions Install PHP and required extensions: sh sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-json php-mbstring php-xml php-dom php-simplexml php-fileinfo php-curl php-gd Verification: Create a PHP File to verify installation: sh echo \"<?php phpinfo(); ?>\" | sudo tee /var/www/html/info.php Navigate to http://localhost/info.php , where the PHP information page will be visible. 6. Advanced PHP Configuration Adjust PHP settings for better performance: sh sudo nano /etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini This subsequent part is very important and something that I had trouble with. Don't forget to do this. Suggested adjustments: memory_limit = 256M upload_max_filesize = 64M post_max_size = 64M max_execution_time = 300 7. Install Composer and Git Install Composer and Git: sh sudo apt install composer sudo apt install git Version Control Verification: sh composer --version git --version 8. Install Omeka S Navigate to the web root and clone the Omeka S repository: sh cd /var/www/html sudo git clone https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s.git 9. Set File Permissions Set the correct file permissions: sh sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/omeka-s sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/omeka-s 10. Install Omeka S Dependencies with Composer Install dependencies: sh cd omeka-s sudo composer install 11. Create a Host Config for Apache Create a new virtual host configuration: sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/omeka-s.conf Add the following content to the config file: <VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html/omeka-s <Directory /var/www/html/omeka-s> Options Indexes FollowSymLinks AllowOverride All Require all granted </Directory> ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined </VirtualHost> 12. Enable the Virtual Host and Restart Apache Enable the virtual host and restart Apache: sh sudo a2ensite omeka-s.conf sudo systemctl restart apache2 13. Finalize Omeka S Installation Open a web browser and navigate to http://your-server-ip/omeka-s Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Omeka S setup, entering the database information created earlier. 14. Enable HTTPS (Optional) Install Certbot for SSL/TLS configuration: sh sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache sudo certbot --apache Follow Certbot's instructions to obtain and install a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. 15. Optimize MySQL Configuration Consider optimizing MySQL for better performance: sh sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf Add or modify configurations like: ini innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G query_cache_size = 64M query_cache_type = 1 16. Enable Error Logging for Debugging Ensure error logging is enabled to assist with troubleshooting: apache php_flag display_errors Off php_flag log_errors On php_value error_log /var/www/html/omeka-s/php_errors.log 17. Set Up Cron Jobs for Maintenance (Optional) I didn't do this, but in retrospect would be better to complete Set up cron jobs for regular maintenance tasks: sh crontab -e Add tasks such as: cron 0 3 * * * php /var/www/html/omeka-s/application/data/scripts/backup.php 18. Security Considerations Secure MySQL: Ensure proper security practices are followed, such as securing the MySQL root account and using strong passwords. 19. Backup Procedures Document a simple backup procedure for Omeka S data: sh mysqldump -u omeka_user -p omeka_s > /path/to/backup/omeka_s_backup.sql By following these steps and meeting the system requirements, Omeka S will be effectively installed and configured on a LAMP stack, providing a robust platform for managing and sharing digital collections at 91.9 KCSB FM.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#omeka-s-and-lamp-stack-dependencies","text":"Running Omeka S on a LAMP backend architecture involves several steps, including installing and configuring each component of the stack and then installing Omeka S itself.","title":"Omeka S and LAMP Stack Dependencies"},{"location":"installation/#1-install-elementary-os","text":"Install Elementary OS from the official website and follow the installation instructions.","title":"1.
